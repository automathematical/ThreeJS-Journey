# My Three.js Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I documented my progress through **Three.js Journey**, the ultimate course by **Bruno Simon** to master WebGL and Three.js! This repository showcases my projects, exercises, and learnings as I work toward becoming a skilled Three.js developer.

## About Three.js Journey
Created by Bruno Simon, a renowned French creative developer and WebGL expert, *Three.js Journey* is a comprehensive course designed for beginners and advanced developers alike. It teaches how to build stunning 3D web experiences using **Three.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for WebGL. The course covers:

- **Fundamentals**: Creating scenes, cameras, geometries, materials, and textures.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Animations, lighting, shaders, physics, and optimization.
- **Practical Projects**: Building interactive 3D websites and prototypes.
- **Tools & Integration**: Using Blender, React Three Fiber, and libraries like Cannon.js.
- **Community Support**: Access to a vibrant Discord community with over 21k members for feedback and inspiration.

With over 70 hours of video tutorials, hands-on exercises, and regular updates, the course equips learners with the skills to create immersive 3D visualizations, games, and web experiences.

## My Goal
Through this course, I'm learning to harness Three.js to craft engaging and interactive 3D web applications. This repository includes my practice projects, from basic scenes to complex shaders and animations, as I build a portfolio to showcase my skills as a Three.js developer.

## Repository Contents
- **Projects**: Interactive 3D scenes and websites inspired by course lessons.
- **Exercises**: Code snippets and experiments from the course.
- **Notes**: Key concepts and techniques I've learned.
